    "description": "Sree Sree Thakur Anukulchandra, whose clarion call to resist death, of all sorts, physical and spiritual; has rejuvenated innumerable dwindling souls and awakened umpteenth slumbering minds. He, with His life and sayings, with His own conduct and steps, has shown with great care and love how to enjoy life, live it to the full, with all its fine scents and colours and get rid of the weeds in our character that threaten to spoil all joy and suffocate the vitality before time. He spoke untiringly on how man can walk on the path of being and becoming, not alone but along with the environment. His life and activity have been tuned by a single purpose - to wean man from the clutches of his own passions and lead him into a life of light and bliss."

    "description": "Every individual instinctually loves his own being and desires to keep it unimpaired. So, Being with steps to Becoming with a Living Ideal at the pivot of life—that is the mantra He wanted to infuse as the key to the enjoyment. Enjoyment of life, not of passions. Give a free run to the passions, they will burn you out into a charred existence; control them tightly, they will make you a ridiculous dwarf of a man; but adjust them properly, they will become the very pillars of your existence. But this adjustment is impossible if there is not someone in life who, through his normal conduct, has successfully accomplished a meaningful adjustment of the passions and complexes. Thus, a Living Ideal - a competent and realised man in flesh and blood- in whom all the human qualities are arranged and adjusted at their best in a normal effortless way, is needed as a guide. Such a person works as a mirror, a purifier of human nature. With only loving adherence to HIM can man shape his character and live on the path of existential uplift and enjoyment along with the environment."
